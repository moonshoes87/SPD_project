Need to figure out where the Data library comes from.  Do I need to write a program parsing magic_measurements.txt?  I kind of doubt it, but I'm not sure.  


def magic_read(self,infile):  # called from  self.get_data.  reads magic file and returns a dictionary

This is how the data gets parsed and whatever within thellier_GUI:

class Arai_GUI(wx.Frame):

default self.magic_file = ./magic_measurements.txt # this is how self.get_data functions on initialization

def on_menu_open_magic_file(self, event):
...
	self.Data = self.get_data()  # this is the key one
		  calls self.magic_read() # parses file and returns data dictionary
		  also self.get_specs() # parses file and returns list (?) of specimen names
	self.Data_info=self.get_data_info()

ultimately returns Data
...


I probably want to use def get_PI_parameters().  However, it appears (possibly) that one must do both self.get_data and then self.get_PI_parameters.  At the start of self.get_data, self.Data = {}.  However, at the start of self.get_PI_parameters(), self.Data is referenced as if it were full.  So....
