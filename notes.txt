cart2dir
	require x,y,z
dir2cart
	works with just Dec, Inc
	however, outputs very different value if given Dec, Inc, and m (or whatever)  magnitude is different
	dir2cart(Dec, Inc, 1) --> x,y,z
	dir2cart(Dec, Inc, 2) --> 2x,2y,z
	

thellier_gui Dec, Inc, and MAD are free.  lisa always uses free
Also, checked and numpy and matlab notation for slicing is the same, except that matlab indexing starts at 1, not 0



new meeting notes:

from greig's code:  % ChRM          - a (1 x 2) or a (1 x 3) vector describing an independent measure of the direction of Banc (can be a known direction).
this would make one of my stats wrong.  


for meeting with Ron:


	This from thellier_gui is in contradiction to what's in spd.  this sometimes causes different results for pTRM check statistics
          # If triangle is within the interval but started after the upper temperature bound, then one pTRM check is in
cluded                                                                                                               
          # For example: if T_max=480, the traingle in 450 fall far, and it started at 500, then it is included  
          # the ateration occured between 450 and 500, we dont know when.

#####  Python tips and tricks:  #######

dir(spd) -- gives all methods/classes available in spd.  awesome.  

pop, remove, and del -- useful stuff for lists

*args

if changing a list in your loop, it's better to iterate through indices.  i.e, for i in range(len(list)), vs for i in list

" ".join(row)

list comprehensions --- [x**2 for x in range(10)]

filter() # takes two args, function and iterable.  works well with lambda.

lambda

overriding built in methods -- i.e., __repr__(), which determines how an object prints

you can use *args thusly:  
    a = [1,5]
    range(*a)


to use a list as a queue, use collections.dequeue, to grab off elements from the beginning of a list.  (for using a list as a stack, you can efficiently use append() and pop())

use regex

>>> try:
...     1/0
... except:
...     print "exception"
... else:
...     print "else"
... finally:
...     print "finally"
... 
exception
finally


os.getcwd()
returns working directory, yay!

###Notes for matlab:####

struct is a dictionary(ish)
displays like this:
Params = 

               Xpts: [8x1 double]
               Ypts: [8x1 double]

called like this:
Params.Xpts


Think I sould make a script to write Params in an orderly manner to a tab-delimited file for easy comparison with 

cell array is similar to a Python list.  

my_struct = struct('a', 'b', 'c', 4)
	  a: b
	  c: 4
a = 'x'
my_struct.(a) == my_struct.x
my_struct.a == my_struct.a
isfield(my_struct, 'a') == 1 
fieldnames(my_struct) == [a, c]
orderfields, rmfields


my_cell = struct2cell(my_struct)
	'b'
	4


my_fieldnames = fieldnames(my_struct)
	      a
	      c

Restore data from a MAT-file into the workspace using load.  load myfile.mat.  also save myfile.mat puts workspace variables into a file

num2str -- number to string, obviously.  also int2str

my_cell(1) != my_cell{1}

my_cell(1) is a cell object of length one.  my_cell{1} is the first item

#### comparing my spd and Greig's spd #####

I can find equivalent dec/inc data in the magic measurements vs. .tdt files, but I can't find intensity or magnetic moment data that lines up. Update: this is because it's in different units

dir2cart function is the same in lib and in GetPintParams.tdt.  

    zdata difference:

    % Convert to x, y, z and put into Mvec
    Mvec=NaN(length(Int), 3); %Create an empty matrix
    [Mvec(:,1), Mvec(:,2), Mvec(:,3)]=dir2cart(Dec, Inc, Int);

    % then NRMvec just grabs without changing the appropriate (zerofield) values


    # in thellier_gui_spd, it is essentially the same BUT it does dir2cart([dec, inc, int / NRM]). 
#NRM=zijdblock[0][3]
#for k in range(len(zijdblock)):
 #           DIR=[zijdblock[k][1],zijdblock[k][2],zijdblock[k][3]/NRM]
  #          cart=self.dir2cart(DIR)
   #         zdata.append(array([cart[0],cart[1],cart[2]]))


    This makes zdata quite challenging to compare.  



how x points are attained in tgs:
    [temp, dec, inc, int, other]
    int is grabbed (magnetic intensity) from the infield data points, and normed by the original NRM of the untouched sample.
    dir2cart([dec, inc, int])
y points: 
  same, but with zerofield data points.

######### problems and solutions: #############

solved:

B_anc -- off by a factor of 6.   3.05933660143e-05 vs. 30.6
B_anc sigma -- same
x_pts -- My SPD norms by NRM; Greig's does not
y_pts -- My SPD norms by NRM; Greig's does not
Y_int  ---  same
x_int ---  same
GAP_MAX -- my code norms by partial_vds, Greig's by full vds.  believe mine is correct
       # GAP_MAX = max_diff / vds -- Greig's
       # GAP_MAX = max_diff / partial_vds -- correct
FRAC --- Greig's code does not take the final diff.  Greig will fix his.  
IZZI_MD -- going to Greig to fix his code
NRM_dev:
        radians vs degrees problem.  FIXED
max_DEV:
        once was lost, now is found
Z:
        should use segment, where I was using full data set.  fixed.



 
Pending:

        δt∗  -- I have not coded this statistic
        problem in Greig's IZZI_MD, so he gets a value even when it is all IZ or ZI steps, not alternating.
                update:  need to test with an IZZI type experiment.  for now, I don't have any in tdt format.  But that is ok.
        problem with Greig's B_lab vector [0,0,-1] where should be [0,0,1]
        #GAP-MAX is normed by partial vds according to thellier_gui, but full vds in Greig's current code. 
                # DONE -- Greig has changed his code
        for theta, whether to use best_fit_vector_Anc vs. free.  
                # DONE -- appears that Greig has switched to Free.  hoorah
        FRAC now disagrees with thellier_gui FRAC.  talk to Ron
        does my code need to be able to deal with someone selecting tmin = t[0], tmax = t[1] ?  Greig's produces output in this situation
        magic_measurements is missing one of the Biggin et al .tdt files.  probs no big deal. 
        check get_curve()
              determine whether norming should or should not be done
        r_det2 -- Greig uses full data, you use segment.  which is right?  Greig's was wrong.  should be fixed in next iteration of code.  
        delta_ck - Greig's code is different from SPD document.  Currently, I am in agreement with his code.  This is only an issue for some edge cases.   
                 #  DONE -- SPD document has been changed
        delta_y_prime, delta_x_prime -- using first and last values of x_prime/y_prime vs min and max 
                 # DONE -- SPD document changed


       

current:


theta:
        for ChRM value, Greig uses equivalent to my best_fit_vector_Anc, whereas I've been using best_fit_vector_Free.
        also has slightly different B_lab
gamma:
        also has B_lab problem.  UPDATE: this is now the only problem
        his TRMvec / NRM == my dir2cart([PTRMS[i][1], PTRMS[i][2], PTRMS[i][3] / NRM])
        (in gamma):       my ptrm_cart == his Params.TRMvec(seg_max,2:end) / NRM  (now.  so that's good).  (This is the vector edition of the max pTRM)
mean_DRAT_prime:
delta_pal:
        his TRMvec / NRM == my dir2cart([PTRMS[i][1], PTRMS[i][2], PTRMS[i][3] / NRM])
        his pCheck / NRM == my dir2cart([PTRM_Checks[i][1], PTRM_Checks[i][2], PTRM_Checks[i][3] / NRM])
        his to_sum / NRM == my diffs
        his dpal_sum / NRM == my numpy.cumsum(diffs, 0) == my C

        his xcorr / NRM == my x_star (both segment)
            above is good.  now check below.  (AL3031-1d)
        
        here is the problem!!!  mine b_star is positive, his is negative       
        fixed corr_slope so that it is calculated correctly
        his corr_slope == my b_star
        

        his delta_pal now == my delta_pal!!!!


GAP-MAX -- more problem. 
        think it is a bug of his, have emailed him.

DANG --
     DANG = lib_direct.get_angle_difference(free, cm)
     his dirfit == my free
     his Centre == my cm
     difference is: he subtracts 90 if DANG is larger than 90 (taking the smaller angle)

Ask Ron:

    subtracting from DANG



different possible units for magnetic moment:

mKs.  meter Kelvin seconds.  measurement unit for magnetic moment.  used in magic measurements format.

should be normed by first NRM (full, pre-experiment)

.tdt uses different measurement.  if b (slope) is the same, then it's fine.

be careful with v. large or v. small numbers.  float, long, etc.  this can be significant.  


Don't forget you will need to test everything with EVERY possible set of temperature bounds




style notes:
      stop using tabs!  spaces!




talk to Ron:
delta_y_prime, delta_x_prime
    when x_prime is:
    0.0517
    0.0209
    0.0521
    0.0832
    0.0990
    0.1271
    0.2638
    min, max, first = .0209, .2638, .0517

    Greig uses:    TRM_Len=max(Px(seg))-min(Px(seg));
    where I use: delta_x_prime = abs(x_prime[-1] - x_prime[0])
    Ron is ASKING LISA


    GAP-MAX


    occasionally with fucked up data and the wrong of temperature bound, b is not in fact negative
    see: Bowles etal 200? AL3023_1b
    what to do about this?  should I be calculating b as Greig does?
         x_err = x_segment - x_mean
         y_err = y_segment - y_mean
         york_b = -1* sqrt( sum(y_err**2) / sum(x_err**2) )  # averaged slope 
         # how Greig does it:
         #Params.b=sign(sum(U.*V))*std(Y_seg)/std(X_seg);                                                   
         b = sign(sum(x_err * y_err)) * std(y_segment, ddof=1)/std(x_segment, ddof=1)
    ask Lisa


    AL2360-1b  - xpts come out different in my code vs. Greig's.  Ypts are the same, though.   p
    AL2360_1d  - same
               looks like PTRMS/araiblock is being set incorrectly to [0,0,0] for the second value.  



to do:
   automate testing at multiple temperatures
   add in custom exception if someone tries to pass in temperatures beyond upper or lower bounds



####  long term notes: ####
        if we want, at some point, to really speed of code, consider PyPy


##### Extra notes that might be useful again someday: #####

IZZI_MD -- believe will put IZZI_MD into its own module.  it's big. 
        it's all   ['ZI', 'ZI', 'ZI', 'ZI', 'ZI', 'ZI', 'ZI'] in the new specimens.  in this case, it fails on the get_triangles segment.

        My IZZI_MD and Ron's are not the same.  I think I will just use Ron's.  
        But still, Ron's fails on specimen 'ET1_318A', where Greig's produces output.

        In Greig's code, Treatment -- 0 = ZI, 1 = IZ, etc...

        for all of the Biggin specimens, I get only ZI steps.  however, the araiblock has: 
                araiblock=(first_Z,first_I,ptrm_check,ptrm_tail,zptrm_check,GammaChecks,additivity_check)
                so, how does the araiblock get turned into steps arai?

         in tgs:
          first sortarai()      
         then (zerofields = araiblock[0], infields = araiblock[1] ):

               if "LP-PI-TRM-IZ" in methcodes or "LP-PI-M-IZ" in methcodes:
                    ZI=0
                else:
                    ZI=1

         LP-PI-TRM-IZ:  Paleointensity experiment: Using a laboratory TRM with an in-field step followed by a zero-field step. Heating the specimen to the desired temperature step and then cooling in known ambient magnetic field. Then heating to the same or lower temperature and then cooling in zero magnetic nfield to induce pTRM.
         LP-PI-M-IZ:  Same-ish but with microwave

          if zerofields[k][4]==1:
            steps_Arai.append('ZI')
          else:
            steps_Arai.append('IZ')

      # looking for Thellier Thellier protocol
      if 'LP-PI-II'in methcodes or 'LP-PI-T-II' in methcodes or 'LP-PI-M-II' in methcodes:  
      ....
            first_Z.append([temp,DIR_zerofield[0],DIR_zerofield[1],DIR_zerofield[2],0])
            first_I.append([temp,DIR_infield[0],DIR_infield[1],DIR_infield[2],0])

  Neither condition which would trigger ZI to be 0 is ever getting met.  In other words: in magic_measurements, the method codes for IZ step are not being found.  In the tdt files, there are clear IZ steps.  
  Also, cross-checked with Lisa's thellier_magic, which also didn't grab any IZ points (only closed red circles in graph, no blue)

        in read_tdt:
           ET1_318A    150.1   6.457964075 214.5410563 -10.52823962
           treatment is:   1 
           etc. (0 is ZI, 1 is IZ, etc.)
