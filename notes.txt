Need to figure out where the Data library comes from.  Do I need to write a program parsing magic_measurements.txt?  I kind of doubt it, but I'm not sure.  


def magic_read(self,infile):  # called from  self.get_data.  reads magic file and returns a dictionary

This is how the data gets parsed and whatever within thellier_GUI:

class Arai_GUI(wx.Frame):

default self.magic_file = ./magic_measurements.txt # this is how self.get_data functions on initialization

def on_menu_open_magic_file(self, event):
...
	self.Data = self.get_data()  # this is the key one
		  calls self.magic_read() # parses file and returns data dictionary
		  also self.get_specs() # parses file and returns list (?) of specimen names
	self.Data_info=self.get_data_info()

ultimately returns Data
...


I probably want to use def get_PI_parameters().  However, it appears (possibly) that one must do both self.get_data and then self.get_PI_parameters.  At the start of self.get_data, self.Data = {}.  However, at the start of self.get_PI_parameters(), self.Data is referenced as if it were full.  So....




  #      self.pars['magic_method_codes']=Data[self.s]['pars']['magic_method_codes']                           
        # for some reason missing any magic_method_codes.  possibly these would have been incorporated into the data from rmag_anisotr
opy or something                                                                                                                     
    # magic_method codes are locked up in datablock, not actually extracted.  not sure if this happens somewhere else in thellier_\
gui or not                                         
There's some stuff in the code like:

        for rec in self.Data[self.s]['datablock']:
          if "LT-NO" in rec['magic_method_codes']:
              nrm0= "%.2e"%float(rec['measurement_magn_moment'])
              break

But nowhere do the magic_method codes get pulled out and organized
                                                                             
        # also, fix the weirdness of having to set the precise number for tmin and tmax    

next:  
       experiment with get_PI_parameters.  try running it in the console (using lj version), see what happens
       

sequence to get Data to feed into spd.py:
>>> import lj_thellier_gui_spd as tgs
>>> tgs
<module 'lj_thellier_gui_spd' from 'lj_thellier_gui_spd.py'>
>>> gui = tgs.Arai_GUI()
__init__ Arai_gui instance
.....
>>> gui.Data
.... (necessary Data for spd.py)
